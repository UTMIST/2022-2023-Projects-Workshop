Toronto’s most influential Machine Learning (ML) club will guide you on completing certified courses (from beginner to full professional) and making unique projects — a chance to expand your knowledge and your network with like-minded people. Whether you are a complete beginner or a strong ML enthusiast, UTMIST project workshops are perfect for you if you are determined to be along those that bring a change to the world through the ability of computational power.
